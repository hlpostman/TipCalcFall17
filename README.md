# Pre-work - *EasyTip*

**EasyTip** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Hannah Lily Postman**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [x] Settings page with 3 different keyboard themes
- [x] Custom UIButton class RoundButton with IBDesignable and IBInspectable attributes for repeatable easy design of custom buttons
- [x] In-app keyboard
- [x] Keyboard always visible
- [x] Handles decimal entry first time touched and not for additional touches

## Notes

I spent a bunch of time on features that are only partially implemented and on features I deleted in favour of something else.  Some things I am familiar with and want to do: get the slider working, add auto layout, implement the Round Up setting, make it so that when the tip and/or total comes to an even amount, the floating “.00” is not shown (if tipAmount == tipAmount/1 show tipAmount/1 or something), make sure at most 2 decimals are shown at any time, round the corners of the bill/tip/total fields (very odd to me that myLabel.layer.cornerRadius isn’t working), set the sizes of all the buttons and labels relative to the view size so they size dynamically based on device, add USD formatting and possibly currency conversion (something I did in my application for CodePath last spring), think of a new UI setup for split tips and implement that (last year my tip calculator always showed the tip for 1, 2, and a set-by-user amount), create a custom gear icon in Sketch3 and use that as the rightBarButtonItem instead of the word “Settings”, add a “delete” function for character-by-character deletion of bill input, and add a “clear” function for the whole bill. Some things I am not familiar with but want to try: adding Apple’s accessibility features such as sound, writing unit tests, writing UI tests, laying the app out differently for portrait vs landscape views.  

Something I worked on for a while but haven’t gotten working is animating the labels that say “Bill”, “Tip”, and “Total” so that they start out large, but (1) shrink and move to the upper left-hand corner of their respective parent view when a bill begins to be entered, and (2) return to their original size and position if the bill field is cleared.

I haven’t succeeded in changing the title of the main screen which is currently blank to “Tip Calculator”, and I haven’t been able to change the arrow and title of the leftBarButtonItem that were automatically generated by the navigationViewController. I’d like to have no arrow and a rightBarButtonItem that says “Done” or a leftBarButtonItem that says “Tip Calculator”.  This is another thing I’d like to address.
